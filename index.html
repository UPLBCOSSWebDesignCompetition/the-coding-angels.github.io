                <br/>
                <p class="text">There is a concerning trend in global poverty, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has halted decades of progress in poverty reduction. It predicts that by 2030, approximately 575 million people will still be living in extreme poverty, particularly challenging in sub-Saharan Africa and conflict-affected regions. Despite some expansion in social protection during the pandemic, over 4 billion people globally remain without adequate coverage. Historical trends suggest only one-third of countries will halve their national poverty rates by 2030, and social protection coverage remains insufficient for various vulnerable groups. To effectively combat poverty, there's a call for increased action and investment in job creation and social services, emphasizing the need to redirect public resources toward essential services.</p>

                <p class="text">There is an escalating issue of hunger and food insecurity worldwide, with the number of affected individuals rising steadily since 2015, exacerbated by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict, climate change, and inequality. Despite global efforts, projections suggest that by 2030, approximately 670 million people will still face hunger, equal to the number in 2015. Challenges persist in reducing malnutrition among children, necessitating a 2.2-fold increase in the current rate of reduction in stunting to meet global targets. Urgent action is required to transform food systems, enhance food security, and invest in sustainable agricultural practices to achieve zero hunger by 2030. Additionally, various targets address issues such as the increase in food insecurity due to the pandemic, the stagnation in reducing overweight children, declining investments in agriculture, the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, and the ongoing challenge of fluctuating food prices, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and least developed countries.</p>

                <p class="text">It is noted that the challenges facing the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3), exacerbated by the pandemic and ongoing crises, lead to a rise in health inequalities and threatening universal health coverage. Notably, there's an alarming increase in the number of un- or under-vaccinated children, especially in low- and middle-income countries, alongside a slow decline in maternal mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates, with urgent efforts required to meet the 2030 targets. Progress towards ending communicable diseases remains off track, with setbacks observed in reducing HIV infections, TB, and malaria cases. Additionally, there's a need to bolster health systems and address the shortage of health workers, especially in regions with high disease burdens. Efforts to enhance family planning services and childhood vaccinations also require immediate attention to ensure universal access to healthcare services.</p>

Without additional measures, only a small fraction of countries will meet Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4) by 2030, leaving millions of children without access to quality education and lacking essential numeracy and literacy skills. Despite some improvements in school completion rates, progress has slowed, and learning levels have stagnated, with documented losses due to pandemic-related school closures. Access to pre-primary education remains limited, and participation in education and training for youth and adults is insufficient. Basic school infrastructure and teacher qualifications are also highlighted as areas needing attention. Reimagining education systems and prioritizing education financing are crucial for achieving SDG4 effectively.

These factors are predicted to slow down global economic growth, jeopardizing advancements in equitable pay and decent work. While global real GDP per capita increased in 2021, forecasts indicate a slowdown in growth, particularly impacting LDCs. Informal employment remains a prevalent issue with around 2 billion workers lacking social protection, and productivity growth has been declining globally. The global unemployment rate has slightly decreased but remains a concern, especially among young people, with nearly one in four not in education, employment, or training. Additionally, child labor has increased, and while tourism's economic contribution is recovering, challenges persist in achieving sustainable development goals related to finance access and digital solutions. Addressing these issues will require comprehensive reforms in the financial system to tackle rising debts and promote equitable pay and decent work for all.

However, the pandemic and subsequent uneven recoveries across regions threaten to reverse this trend and exacerbate global inequality. Record numbers of people are fleeing conflicts and economic hardship, with one in 251 people worldwide being a refugee by mid-2022, the highest proportion ever documented. Achieving SDG 10 requires addressing the root causes of wage disparities and access to resources within and between countries. Despite some progress, challenges remain, such as the persistence of a high share of people living below half the median income in many countries and a decline in the share of economic output earned by workers over the past decade. Additionally, the global average cost of sending remittances remains high, exceeding the SDG target.

The number of people living in slums or slum-like conditions in urban areas has been steadily growing, exacerbating the housing crisis, particularly in developing countries. Access to public transportation remains inadequate for over half of the world's urban population, and the physical expansion of cities outpaces population growth, highlighting challenges in urban planning. Waste management also remains a concern, with a significant portion of municipal solid waste left uncollected, contributing to pollution and health risks. To achieve SDG 11, efforts must focus on strengthening urban planning capacities, improving public transportation access, enhancing waste management systems, and increasing the proportion of open public spaces in cities. Additionally, increasing the number of countries with local governments equipped with disaster risk reduction strategies is crucial for building resilience in urban areas.

There is an urgent need for responsible consumption and production practices to be integrated into the pandemic recovery efforts, alongside accelerating the decoupling of economic growth from resource use. While reporting on corporate sustainability has increased significantly since the start of the SDG period, there is room for improvement, particularly in reporting activities contributing to the SDGs. Key policies supporting the transition to sustainable practices have been implemented, but there are regional disparities in reporting and progress. Despite efforts, post-harvest food losses remain stagnant, far from the goal of halving them by 2030. Additionally, fossil fuel subsidies have risen, posing a challenge to sustainability efforts. To achieve SDG12, robust policies promoting sustainable practices and reducing resource use are essential.

Failure to act risks the lives of billions of people, leading to worsening heatwaves, droughts, floods, wildfires, sea-level rise, and famines. Emissions must be nearly halved by 2030 to combat climate change effectively. Despite some progress in disaster risk reduction strategies and climate finance, global temperatures have already exceeded 1.1°C, and emissions continue to rise, surpassing pre-industrial levels. Furthermore, climate change education remains inadequate, with a significant portion of national curriculum frameworks lacking mention of climate change, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive climate action and education.
